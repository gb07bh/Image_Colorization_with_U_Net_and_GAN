        "In all papers we studied and all codes we checked out on colorization on GitHub, people use L\\*a\\*b color space instead of RGB to train the models. There are a couple of reasons for this choice but I'll give you an intuition of why we make this choice. To train a model for colorization, we should give it a grayscale image and hope that it will make it colorful. When using L\\*a\\*b, we can give the L channel to the model (which is the grayscale image) and want it to predict the other two channels (\\*a, \\*b) and after its prediction, we concatenate all the channels and we get our colorful image. But if you use RGB, you have to first convert your image to grayscale, feed the grayscale image to the model and hope it will predict 3 numbers for you which is a way more difficult and unstable task due to the many more possible combinations of 3 numbers compared to two numbers. If we assume we have 256 choices (in a 8-bit unsigned integer image this is the real number of choices) for each number, predicting the three numbers for each of the pixels is choosing between 256³ combinations which is more than 16 million choices, but when predicting two numbers we have about 65000 choices (actually, we are not going to wildly choose these numbers like a classification task and we just wrote these numbers to give you an intuition)."

In a vanilla discriminator, the model outputs one number (a scaler) which represents how much the model thinks the input (which is the whole image) is real (or fake). In a patch discriminator, the model outputs one number for every patch of say 70 by 70 pixels of the input image and for each of them decides whether it is fake or not separately. Using such a model for the task of colorization seems reasonable to me because the local changes that the model needs to make are really important and maybe deciding on the whole image as in vanilla discriminator cannot take care of the subtleties of this task. Here, the model's output shape is 30 by 30 but it does not mean that our patches are 30 by 30. The actual patch size is obtained when you compute the receptive field of each of these 900 (30 multiplied by 30) output numbers which in our case will be 70 by 70."
